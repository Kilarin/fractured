This mod lets you add different lua landscape generators based on coords.

**Realms version 0.0**

When I first started working on the Fractured game, my vision was of a world with multiple layers, or "realms" going both up and down through the minetest 64k by 64k cube.  Realms is an attempt to fulfill that vision.  
The purpose of Realms is to allow the user to control multiple landscape and biome generators with exact precision.  Specifying exactly what generator should run where, and what biomes should be active, etc.

It is perhaps best to explain with an example.
